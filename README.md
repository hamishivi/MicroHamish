# MicroHamish - A collection of Microservices
## Made for FreeCodeCamp

These microservices were made as part of the freecodecamp backend curriculum. They were originally all their own git projects, but I condensed them into one project. Descriptions can be found [here](https://microhamish.herokuapp.com/), as well as the microservices themselves.
